<td width="900px" style="width:1000px;text-align=justify">The measurement rate of cameras that take spatially  multiplexed measurements by using spatial light modulators 
  (SLM) is often limited by the switching speed 
  of the SLMs. This is especially true for single-pixel 
  cameras where the photodetector operates at a rate 
  that is many orders-of-magnitude greater than the SLM. 
  We study the factors that determine the measurement 
  rate for such spatial multiplexing cameras (SMC) and 
  show that increasing the number of pixels in the device 
  improves the measurement rate, but there is an optimum 
  number of pixels (typically, few thousands) beyond 
  which the measurement rate does not increase. This motivates 
  the design of LiSens, a novel imaging architecture, 
  that replaces the photodetector in the single-pixel 
  camera with a 1D linear array or a line-sensor. We illustrate 
  the optical architecture underlying LiSens, build a  prototype, and demonstrate results of a range of indoor 
  and outdoor scenes. LiSens delivers on the promise of 
  SMCs: imaging at a megapixel resolution, at video rate, 
  using an inexpensive low-resolution sensor.</td>

	</td>
	<td width="100%"><p>A classical work in compressive sensing imaging is the single pixel camera (SPC). The left figure shows one  of the best-known results on real hardware to date. This result is only 128*128 images at video rate. We should stop and think for a second  that why cannot we get megapixel-images at video rate using the SPC.<br>
	  The answer for this is two folds. <br>
	  (1) Natural scenes are increasingly  compressible when resolved at higher resolutions. As a  consequence, while high-resolution images are highly compressible, the same is not  true for lower-resolution ones.<br>
	  (2)  SPC has very poor measurement rate and  hence, is not conducive to sensing at high spatial  and temporal resolutions. Here the measurement rate is defined as the number of measurements that a device can obtain in unit time.</p></td>

	<b>Fig: Natural scenes are increasingly  compressible when resolved at higher spatial resolutions</b></td>
	<td width="100%"><p>We collect a bunch of 90 megapixel images of natural scenes. We do wavelet transform to images first,  then  keep the  largest K wavelet coefficients  unchanged and set the others to zero, and use the modified coefficients to  reconstruct the image.	  Suppose  the image has N pixels, so we have N wavelet coefficients. We define K/N as the  non-zero ratio. <br>
	  When  setting nonzero ratio to 1%, we found that for  higher-resolutions,  the reconstruction SNR is much larger. When setting the nonzero ratio to 10%, we observe the same thing.<br>
	  Next,  we require the reconstruction SNR to be greater than 25dB, and find the &ldquo;range  of nonzero ratio&rdquo; for different resolutions. We found that for  higher-resolutions,  the required nonzero ratio is lower.</p>    </td>

	<b>Fig: Replace single pixel by multiple pixels</b>	
	</td>
	<td width="100%"><p>We found that &ldquo;Natural images are increasingly compressible when resolved  at higher (spatial) resolutions&rdquo; which implies that we can expect  compressive sensing techniques to perform better when we sense signals at higher resolutions.  The  challenge of compressive sensing at high-resolutions is that resolving  scenes at high spatial-temporal resolutions, even with a&nbsp; compressive camera, requires very high  measurement rate.<br>
        A natural extension to the SPC design is  to replace the single pixel by multiple pixels, so  that we can achieve measurement rates that are orders of magnitude larger, and  therefore realize  imaging systems capable of sensing at high spatial  and temporal resolutions. </p>

	<br>
	<b>Fig: Optimal number of pixels</b>	
	</td>
	<td width="100%"><p>There is a minimum # of  pixels at which we can achieve the max possible measurement rate. When pixels are costly, as in the case of  SWIR imaging, we want to operate at this particular  point because  it gives us a sensor that&rsquo;s of very low resolution and inexpensive but  yet gives  us a measurement rate that's as high as what's possible given the architecture  constraints.<br>
	  The optimal  # of pixels is ADC rate over DMD rate, which is typically 1000s of pixels.<br>
	  The  implication to this is that we can obtain measurement rate of  a full-frame sensor but with a fraction of the number of pixels! (less than  0.1% pixels)</p>

	    We make  two modifications to the SPC architecture.<br>
      First,  we use a  linear array of pixels or a line-sensor to replace the photodetector.<br>
      Second, we add a cylindrical lens to  tightly focus the DMD onto the line-sensor.</p></td>

      <p><b>Fig: Line sensor Vs. 2D sensor array</b></p></td>
	  <td><p>We can use a line sensor or a 2D  sensor to replace the photo-detector. We  choose to use line sensor for two reasons.<br>
      First,  alignment is significantly easier. Because  we use the same pattern for each row, slight crosstalk doesn&rsquo;t matter.<br>
      Second, because a 1D sensor only uses a single line, there are  a lot of space in top and bottom  sides.  Without losing the 100% fill factor of  each pixel, we can have additional technology like frame transfer, or per-pixel  ADC  which can boost the measurement rate from MHZ to GHZ. All of these are only possible for 1D  sensor because  we have lots of space for circuitry in two directions which is not true for a 2D  sensor.</p>
